# Wine Quality Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the quality of wines based on various chemical properties.
The dataset used for this analysis contains information about red and white wines, including features such as acidity, pH levels, alcohol content, and quality ratings.
The goal is to develop models that can predict the quality of wines based on these features.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis can be found in the 'data' directory. It includes two separate CSV files for red and white wines. The columns in each file represent different chemical properties and the quality rating of the wines.
